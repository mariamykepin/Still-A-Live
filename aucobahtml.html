	<li><h4><strong>YATO</strong><h/4></li>
		<p>My first beloved <em>ayank</em> is yato from noragami. In the past, his name was Yaboku.<br> The god of war who is known to be poor and does not have a temple is his real name Yaboku. <br>In the past, Yato was known as the most heinous disaster god who did not hesitate to kill anyone.<br>This was the main reason he changed his name to Yato, so he could bury his dark past.</p>
	<li><h4><strong>MIKETSUKAMI SOUSHI</strong><h/4></li>
